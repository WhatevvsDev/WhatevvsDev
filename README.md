Hi! My name is Matt and I am a C++ programmer, currently studying games programming at the Breda University of Applied Sciences.

I have an interest in graphics programming, and have worked with OpenGL and DirectX 12. I also have some experience with CPU raytracing and am currently working on a hobby raytracer in my free time (Check it out here -> [Hakner](https://github.com/WhatevvsDev/Hakner)).
